*   **Strategy:** "Show, don't tell." Create fast, compelling, almost shocking results. Use text overlays and trending sounds.
*   **Content Ideas:**
    1.  **"I Uploaded My Entire ChatGPT History..." Video:** A 25-second video. Start with a screen recording of a massive ChatGPT history. Use a voiceover: "I asked this AI to analyze my 2 million words of chat history... I was not ready for what it found." Cut to MindVault's dashboard, zooming in on the #1 ranked idea with a high Day 1 Revenue Target.
    2.  **"3 AI Tools for Lazy Entrepreneurs" Video:** Position MindVault as the ultimate "idea finder" alongside other popular tools.
    3.  **Duet/Stitch a popular "side hustle" video:** Show someone talking about a business idea, then stitch it with a screen recording of you inputting that idea into MindVault to get an instant Opportunity Score.

    *   **(7-12s):** Show the MindVault dashboard animating, with idea cards flying into a ranked list. The Opportunity Score dials spin up. **Sound:** Upbeat, dramatic music swell.
    *   **(12-15s):** Freeze on the #1 idea: "AI-Powered Email Marketing Campaigns" with a score of "91.4". **Text Overlay:** "And it found the $12,500/mo winner."
    *   **(15-18s):** Final CTA screen. **Text:** "Stop guessing. Start building. Link in Bio. #SideHustle #AI #Tech #Founder"

## 3. Tactical & Innovative Marketing Ideas

1.  **The "MindVault Score" Challenge:**
    *   Launch a 1-week challenge on Twitter/LinkedIn. Ask users to sign up, upload their history, and post a screenshot of their highest "Opportunity Score".
    *   **Prize:** The user with the highest verifiable score gets a $1,000 grant to build the idea and a lifetime "Founder" tier account. This generates massive social proof and user-generated content.

2.  **Niche-Specific Onboarding Funnels:**
    *   Create lightweight, alternate landing pages for specific niches (e.g., `mindvault.com/for-writers`, `mindvault.com/for-developers`).
    *   Each page uses language and examples tailored to that audience. "Turn your interview notes into a book outline" for writers, or "Find the next great API idea in your developer logs" for developers.

3.  **The "Idea Autopsy" Report:**
    *   A free tool or blog series where you analyze famous failed startups. You'd feed their publicly available pitch decks and interviews into MindVault to generate a "retroactive" Opportunity Score, showing where the R.U.M.E. metrics predicted failure. This establishes MindVault as a powerful analytical tool.

4.  **Zapier & Make.com Integration:**
    *   This is a product feature that doubles as a marketing strategy. Announce the ability to automatically pipe conversations from Slack, Discord, and Telegram into MindVault.
    *   **Marketing Angle:** "Your team's Slack is your new Head of R&D. MindVault finds the revenue-generating ideas your team is already discussing."

## 4. Image & Video Prompts for Generative AI

*   **Hero Image for Landing Page:**
    > "Ultra-wide cinematic shot, a glowing, translucent brain made of interconnected data nodes and abstract code, floating in a dark, minimalist space. In the center of the brain, a single, intensely bright node pulses with a teal-colored light, labeled 'Opportunity Score: 92.5'. Style: photorealistic, 8K, depth of field, inspired by the movie 'Her' and 'Ex Machina'."

*   **Instagram Ad Video (15 seconds):**
    > "A fast-paced motion graphics video. Start with a chaotic storm of words, icons, and emojis swirling randomly. A sleek, dark logo 'MindVault' appears and sucks the chaos into it like a vortex. The vortex resolves into a clean, organized dashboard with 3 cards, each with a title and a score. The top card, 'AI Email Campaigns', glows brightly. End on the tagline: 'MindVault. Your forgotten ideas, found.' with a 'Start Free' button."

*   **Explainer Video Character:**
    > "A friendly, approachable 3D animated robot character, 'Vaulty'. Its head is a screen that can display charts and data. It has one large, expressive eye. The body is sleek, white, and minimalist. Vaulty should be animated to look helpful and intelligent, guiding the user through the MindVault interface."
